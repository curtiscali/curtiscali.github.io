## About

My name is Curtis Cali, and I am a recent graduate from the Software Engineering program at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I am looking to help people and improve their lives using my unique skill set.

My primary development interests are in the web sphere, primarily with UI and UX development. I have always enjoyed the visual feedback that comes from UI development as well as the direct impact it has on the end user.

When I'm not writing code, I spend my time either playing video games or researching random items of interest to me, such as traditional Chinese culture.

Expect posts about technology, video games, culture, and the intersection between these!
